External Software and OMERO
===========================

Here we describe how to use third party tools to analyze data stored in OMERO.
We provide installation instructions, step-by-step workflow either to use the User Interface
of those tools or their API.

- :doc:`cellprofiler/docs/index` is a free open-source software for quantitative analysis of biological images. We demonstrate how to integrate CellProfiler and OMERO using the CellProfiler Python API and the OMERO Python API.

- :doc:`fiji/docs/index` is a popular free open-source image processing package based on ImageJ, https://imagej.net/Fiji. We demonstrate how to use Fiji User Interface and OMERO and we also demonstrate how to analyze data in OMERO using Fiji scripting facility.

- :doc:`orbit/docs/index` is a free open-source software with the focus on quantification of big images like whole slide scans. It offers sophisticated image analysis algorithms. Of those, tissue quantification using machine learning techniques, object/cell segmentation, and object classification are the basic ones. We demonstrate how to integrate Orbit and OMERO using both the User Interface and the API.

- :doc:`qupath/docs/index` is a free open-source cross-platform software application designed for bioimage analysis - and specifically to meet the needs of whole slide image analysis and digital pathology. We demonstrate how to integrate QuPath and OMERO using the User Interface.

- :doc:`trackmate/docs/index` is Fiji plugin for single-particle tracking. We demonstrate how to use TrackMate and OMERO using both the User Interface and the API.
