OMERO Application Programming Interfaces
========================================

The OMERO Application Programming Interface (API) allows clients to be written in Java, Python, R, C++ or MATLAB.
In this section we show how to set up the various libraries and
use a combination of Jupyter notebook and scripts to demonstrate how to use the APIs.

- :doc:`matlab/docs/index` demonstrates how to install and use the MATLAB toolbox

- :doc:`python/docs/index` demonstrates how to use the Python API using Jupyter notebooks

- :doc:`r/docs/index` includes how to set up the R gateway and how to use it either via script or Jupyter notebook.
