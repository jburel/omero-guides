OMERO guide
===========

The OMERO guide is divided into several parts:

:doc:`core_features` covers how to get started, import and manage data.

:doc:`add_ons` includes instructions for installing Web and Command Line Interface plugins
and how to use those extensions points e.g. OMERO.figure, OMERO.parade.

:doc:`api_usage` allows clients to be written in Java, Python, R, C++ or MATLAB. This section includes installation instructions and an exhaustive list of examples.

:doc:`external_tools` introduces how to analyze data using third party tools e.g. Fiji, CellProfiler, ilastik. 

All the guides are hosted on GitHub. If you wish to create a new guide, check the instructions on :doc:`write_guide`.
