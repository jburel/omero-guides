OMERO guide
===========

The OMERO guide is divided into several parts:

:doc:`core_features` introduces the user-facing client applications and how to
get started, import and manage data.

:doc:`add_ons` includes instructions for installing plugins e.g. OMERO.figure
and how to use those extensions points.

:doc:`api_usage` includes instructions for using the various API e.g. Python API
and provides an exhaustive list of examples.

:doc:`external_tools` introduces how to analyze data using third party tools e.g. Fiji. 

All the guides are hosted on GitHub. If you wish to create a new guide, check the instructions on :doc:`write_guide`.
